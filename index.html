Subject: Leave Application for Sisterâ€™s Marriage

Sir/Mam,

With most respect it is to be stated that I am Vikas gupta working as software developer within your prestigious organization since last few months. Blissfully, I have to inform you about the marriage ceremony of my elder sister which is on 30th in april month. For this, I would be requiring leave for 11 days(22/04/2021 to 2/05/2021). As, on this special occassion the work load also gets doubled. Kindly, it would be huge favour if you allow me the leave for mentioned days. I shall be beholden to you for this.

Thanking you I remain.

Sincerely,

Vikas gupta.
Software developer.
